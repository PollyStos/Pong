# Pong

I developed a game on the Unity platform as part of my 2D game development studies. I used it as a practical exercise proposed in a video tutorial I found on YouTube. The game was created with the goal of improving my skills and knowledge in this field, as well as allowing me to put into practice the concepts I've learned.

During the game creation process, I explored the features offered by Unity for 2D game development, such as sprite creation and the implementation of movement and collision mechanics.
